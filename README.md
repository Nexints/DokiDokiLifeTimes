# Doki Doki LifeTimes

This serves as the official Github repo for Doki Doki LifeTimes, an upcoming DDLC mod worked on by Nexint. We're still in our early stages, so issues will be present in the mod and characters may not act like themselves. Feedback is appreciated on this actively developing mod!

# Disclaimer
- **This is the SECOND rewrite of DDLT.**
- This mod does not claim to replace DDLC in any way, shape or form. This mod assumes you have played through the original game, and may contain spoilers for DDLC.
- DDLC files are required to play this mod. You may download DDLC at https://ddlc.moe/.
- This mod is free forever, and (currently) open source. Only my assets in this mod are free to use, and other assets are under the authors terms.
- I have a lack of time to work on this mod, so new releases will be heavily delayed. I still wish to hear feedback though!

# Jist:

You’ve only seen one side of the DDLC cast. What will you do when you’re with them for their entire life? Will you make the right choices?

This mod takes place in a pre-DDLC, post-libitina simulation, where each of the Dokis are free from the horrors that plagued them in the past. You've only met Sayori in the past, but you now have the chance to experience lifetimes with the Dokis, and maybe, escape to the physical world with the Dokis.

# Plans for the mod:
- Finish Act 0 (Prologue)
- Release an actual release of Act 0
- Work on Act 1

**Quirks:**

- Tragic routes are possible, where some of the dokis die. All tragic routes are avoidable in this mod though, and there are good endings for each Doki!
- Adding onto this: If a doki dies, the lifetime continues without them.
- Marrying one of the dokis (and more!) is possible in the final release of this mod.
- Dating all the dokis at once is impossible with this mod. Sayori is canonically monogamous in the official game.
- Other perspectives may be added in eventually!

# Copyright / IP Guidelines Issues:
- Contact business@nexint.org if there are any copyright issues in this mod, and I will try to resolve them as fast as I can. (Suggested method of communication!)
- Alternate E-mail: Nexint@nexint.org
- Contact @Nexint on Discord for any questions about this mod, issues, and feedback. I'll reply as soon as I can!

# Additional notes:
- Act 0 is an actual fully-fledged mod in of itself. While Act 0 is the background before the events of DDLC, there will be enough content in Act 0 to make it a mod in of itself.
- Choices are limited.
- I've open sourced this project and released what I had in order to show that mod development is ongoing. This mod is not ready for public release, and still uses plenty of placeholders.
- Contact me if you would like to join the development team! Currently looking for artists and writers to help with mod progression.
- This mod will be released in seperate acts.

# Credits (Additional credits in credits.txt)
- This mod was made possible with GanstaKingofSA's Doki Doki Mod Maker.
- Ideas bounced from DDLC, other manga / anime series, other DDLC mods, and more. Notable examples: DDLC: SNAFU, DDLA, and more.
