DDLT Patch Notes:

0.2.0 + 0.2.1 Patch notes:
- Included patch notes inside the game package
- Rewrote the beginning, changed the beginning player name to the current username, most of Sayori's route, other segments of this mod, and removed the confession. (Confession will come back later, but not at the next update.)
- Included the framework for the phone system (Better EMR Phone by Elckarow, found at https://github.com/Elckarow/Better-EMR-Phone). Will be implemented in the next update! (0.3)
- Updated credits accordingly.
- Improved on lore a lot more. The story should make more sense now, while still keeping the original ideas!
- Included Sayori's POV! (POV Swaps taken from Lost Ascension POV swaps)
- Improved pacing (albeit time skips still exist due to the length of the mod)
- Squashed lots of bugs with the game.
- Added additional lore.
(Important: Massive update, expect potential bugs with this update. Older versions are available in the releases tab.)
- Doki Doki LifeTimes has been shortened to DDLT internally, except for game tag.
- Fixed Patchnotes
Additional Notes:
- This update focuses heavily on Sayori's route. While other routes may eventually be possible, as the Doki Doki Literature Club canon is about Sayori and the MC being childhood best friends, I focused heavily on this part of the mod.
- I'm still a solo developer (as of now), and while I have used other assets from various sources (found in the credits.txt document), I have done all of the scripting and writing by myself.
- If something looks off / astray in this mod, please don't be afraid to let me know! Constructive criticism is always appreciated.
- Phone system and custom videos have been rescheduled for 0.3
- Rainclouds included. Please let me know if my interpretation is wrong!
- Stats may potentially be included in a future update.
- Past this point, I'll be working on custom DDLT music and videos to suit the game's massive length. I'm also likely going to improve the story externally and work on other projects, so new releases may not come for an extended period.
- I also have a lack of time to work on this mod, so new releases will be heavily delayed. I still wish to hear feedback though!
