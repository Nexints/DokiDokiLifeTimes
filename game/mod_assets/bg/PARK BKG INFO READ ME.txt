PARK INFO:

Three park sprites (park, park_s, and park_n) can be found on Creative Freak's website here: 
http://creativefreaks.net/?page_id=4443&lang=en

These backgrounds cannot be distributed individually, but they can be used (and distributed)
as part of a mod.

They will most likely need to be scaled down to 1280 x 720 for use in a mod. This website can
be used for that: https://www.aconvert.com/image/
