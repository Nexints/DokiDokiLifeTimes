A couple of days later...
I'm awoken by the sun for a brand new day.
But do you really belong here?
[player] doesn't care about you.
He's not going to be there in the morning.
But he's been so nice to me...
I have to get up, as [player] will get worried.
Besides, I have to keep my lie of being this "cute girl" alive.
The facade will fall, just like you.
Wait, I'm late???
I'll have to come up with an excuse for that one.
I'll head off to school now!~
You're late again?
Yeah... But I'm not going to be late again!
I know that's a lie.
Alright. I'm just warning you.
Just don't get [player] worried.
Heyy!
But [player] isn't here.
I told you. You're nothing to him.
I'll just head to school on my own...
I haven't seen [player] at all...
Does he even care about me?
I guess not-
Sayo, are you here?
[player] shouldn't care about you.
You're not good enough for [player].
I'll deal with these rainclouds later.
I'll just go to sle-
*MC Bursts through the door*
Uwaa-
Heyy [player]!
Why were you here?
I just come here to think sometimes...
But everything's alright! See?~
I flash a bright smile to discourage [player] from finding out.
I know something's off. Do you want to talk about it?
It's written all over you.
See? Your little lies have fallen.
I'll still try to keep the lie...
I'm alright! I promise-
Now you're just lying to the one person that showed sympathy for you.
At least he doesn't have to worry.
Alright, if you say so. I'll see you at lunch!
Just let me know if anything's wrong.
That lie... barely worked.
But at least [player] doesnt know exactly what I feel.
It's for the best. At least he doesn't have to worry-
"RIING!"
Welp, it's time to go.
This gives me tons of time to contemplate my feelings for [player].
Do I really like [player]? It's only been a couple of days since meeting him.
And yet, he's the only one whos actually cared.
He probably cares about other people more than you.
Yeah... I assumed so.
This is so confusing... I don't know what to feel.
Earth to Sayori, are you there?
I'm here! Don't worry~
Why were you just standing there?
I'm just going to my typical lunch spot!
I'm not really lying, but I'm also not telling the truth either...
Makes sense. Do you mind if I have a look?
[player]'s just being nice. He doesn't actually care.
But he's been so nice to me...
Because he's nice to everyone that he meets. It's pretty clear, knowing from his attitude.
Ehe~ Alright!
Here it is!~
Woah-
Nice place you got there.
It's quite cozy here!
I just like to sit here and eat with myself.
Won't that make you a little isolated?
And that's where I have to ask...
Do you wanna sit with me?
There's no way [player] says yes.
He doesn't really care about you, he's just nice to everyone.
Sure, I don't mind.
I mean, I don't know where else to sit, so might as well.
You're still nothing to him. He's just being nice because he's nice to everyone else.
You aren't good enough for [player].
But I can still try to make him feel included...
You're always welcome to sit here! Ehe~
Thanks, Sayo.
It seems like he actually does care about me...?
I'm not sure though what I feel about [player]. I've met him 2 days ago, and yet, he's been so caring towards me.
He doesn't care. [player]'s just nice to you because he is.
Honestly, I think [player] could be the one for me. I'd like to ask him out eventually, but I'm scared he'll deny a ditzy girl like myself.
He's more into other girls. He'd pick Monika over you any day of the week.
She is the class star. There's no way [player] will not accept Monika.
It's still worth a shot.
I'm just saying, [player] doesn't care at all about you.
You can try, but there's no way he accepts you.
I'm just the voice of reason.
This is where this route for Doki Doki LifeTimes ends for now.
We're around ~2%% done with this mod, and this route will get more work done on it!
There's so much more I want to add to this mod, so check out the github repository!
A couple months later...
The Depression Arc
It's a fresh morning, just before school.
What day is it...
Ah! It's the first day of school, and we just got our timetables.
Looks like I share Period 1 with Sayori. That's interesting...
Welp, time to get prepared...
I reminisce about the past couple of months.
I met Sayori, learnt more about her, and started hanging out with her almost every day since then.
Sometimes she can get a little tiresome, but overall I enjoyed being around her.
I still have food to prepare though... Those thoughts will be preserved for later.
I know Sayori would want my lunch, so I'll prepare two just in case.
I'll also prepare my breakfast, because we've got time to kill, and I'm hungry.
I should probably check up on Sayori.
We've been friends for only a couple months, but it feels like forever...
*Call initiated*
Hey, Sayori! Are you up yet?
Yeah, I am... I'm just really tired.
I'll be outside soon, waiting for you...
I'll even bring extra food for you during lunch!
Food???
I'll be there as soon as possible!~
*Call Disconnected*
Welp, it's time to go outside and meet Sayori.
Heyy [player]!
Hey, Sayori!
You ready to walk to school together?
Sure! We've always walked together anyway, so why not?
We now share period 1 together... ehe~
No need to get worked up. We're going to be late if we don't go quickly.
Wanna race?
Sure!
*[player] speeds off into the distance*
Uwoa--
I should probably catch up~
It's a normal day in class...
H-Hey!
Nevermind.
I was only kidding... ehe~
Jeez, fine.
I'll get you back!
Am I interrupting something here?
Natsuki, why are you making fun of Sayori?
How do you know my name?
I've been listening in, but that's not important.
You...you perv!
[player]'s not like that!
Are you really sure? He seems like a perv to me.
Alright, cut it out Natsuki.
I'm curious as to why she acts like this...
Hmph.
The teacher's going to catch us talking amongst each other.
Fine, but you're still a perv!
Can't win all your battles, can you?
Turning my focus for a second...
Sayori, are you alright?
Yeah, I'm fine!~
Hey, [player]?
Yeah?
Do you mind helping out with this?
Sure... I'll just need a second-
Kyaa--!
Oopsies...
You okay?
Yeah, this hurts... a lot...
I'll try to find something.
Just wait here for me, alright?
Alright...
What should I get...
Ahh, this!
This'll have to suffice for now.
Besides, Sayori likes apple juice, so I'll get it for her.
Here, I got something.
I hand sayori the bottle that I bought earlier.
Sayo, you realise you're supposed to drink this?
Ahh, sorry...
I must've forgot~
Sayori starts placing the bottle on her head.
This hurts...
It'll be alright. Are you doing okay?
Yeah...
That's all that matters.
It still hurts a lot though... ehe~
You should get it checked out as soon as possible.
It'd be good for you.
Alright...
I'll get this checked out...
Do you know where the nurse's office is?
Yeah.
Alright. I'll see you at lunch!
See you then...
Welp, time to focus in class...
How didn't the teacher notice what happened?
But I can't focus in class.
I've been trying to concentrate, but all I could think about was the past few months.
So much has happened recently, but I've 
I did notice that Sayori acted strangely over the past few days though.
It's almost as she's been pushing me away for some reason.
It's already lunch?
I must've dozed off for a while.
I go over to where I typically hang out...
This place reminds me of Sayori.
Sayori told me about this good lunch spot, and we've stayed here ever since.
But, I wonder if she's here this time. I don't see her.
Is anyone here?
No...
Ah, hi Sayori!
Ehh???
How did you know I was here??
You're just as predictable as I am... Do you want a cookie?
Cookies???
You almost never ask...
But sure!~
I always want cookies-
And now you don't get it for that trick you played.
Shows how predictable you are.
Ehhh?
You promised!!!
Uwaa-
I'm only kidding. Come on, let's go!
Alright!~
Sayori's really excited about this cookie...
...and here's your cookie, Sayori!
Thanks...
Is everything alright?
Yeah! See?
Alright then...
I doubt Sayori's okay. I should try to check on her just before school leaves.
*RING!*
Welp, that's our queue to leave.
Good luck in your classes!
Alright, you too [player]!
They still don't suspect that I'm not from their world.
But, we'll have to see.
We also have Sayori to worry about... She could have something, but I'm not sure what it is.
[player], are you there?
Must've spaced out too long.
Yeah, I must've spaced out for a while.
Ready to walk home together?
As ready as I can be.
Alright! Let's go~
Why do the teachers never notice me spacing out?
That's odd... I should investigate that.
Oh well...
Hey, Sayori?
Yeah?
Is there something on your mind?
You've been as spaced out as I am most of the time.
Meanie!
But there's nothing to worry about~
Alright, just let me know if you need anything, alright?
Something's clearly off about Sayori. This is going to be a lot harder than I thought.
I should potentially check on her when she least expects.
Alright...
Yeah, something's off with Sayori.
This is where this route for Doki Doki LifeTimes ends for now.
We're around ~2%% done with this mod, and this route will get more work done on it!
There's so much more I want to add to this mod, so check out the github repository!
I'll go check on Sayori.
She's been acting weird recently, and I don't know what's up.
Act 1, Day 1
The beginning of it all.
Ahh, a fresh day.
Let's get ready...
Ah, I'm in VM3.
Let's try to act normal for now, and see what happens.
This is going to be interesting though.
Since I'm here, might as well make a light breakfast
Ahh yes, breakfast.
I'll cook some food for myself, and one more just in case.
Three meals later...
Alright. I've got my breakfast and lunch ready.
I also got a third meal, you never know when you need it!
I'll head to school quickly. I'm already late, and I don't want the teachers to start worrying.
But before I do...
I decide to eat my breakfast.
That breakfast was amazing...
Alright. Let's get out of here.
I'm in school now.
Let's see what our schedule is.
Ahh, so this is my schedule.
I have history first, Science second, English third, and Math last.
Got it... but I might skip a few courses.
Welp, I'm not too late.
However, this seems to be history of all things.
This class is really boring.
I hate this already.
And as such, [player] begins to nap in class.
That was a nice nap...
Wait. Where's everyone?
Is it already lunch???
I should probably get downstairs to eat.
I should probably have my lunch here.
I noticed this person feeling down while walking to school...
but I'm overthinking again. It *should be* nothing much, as I don't know her yet.
I'll enjoy my lunch for now, and see what happens later on.
After one wholesome lunch...
That was amazing!
It seems as if my cooking skills have improved.
"RING!"
Fine... I'll get back to class.
I have English now... My worst subject-
It's time to study. I need to ensure that I look focused, and I can't disappoint my parents.
Now that I think of it, where were my parents?
It's none of my business though.
Wait, it's already over?
That went by relatively smoothly.
Man, school sucks. I'll just get outta here.
Finally, I'm out of that place...
Hey!
Fuck off.
Did I annoy you? Ehe~
You fucking suck, you know that?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I can only watch in horror, as this innocent girl dies right in front of me.
She's dead... By WALLACE...
I do the only thing I can.
NOOOOO... Damn you, Wallace.
Maybe I should have chosen a different path.
Oh-
Kyaa!-
I heard this girl tumbling over...
I have a feeling this girl may be important to me.
I decide not to approach.
Welp, it's time to head home.
I guess I'll take a quick stop at the nearby park though...
Let's see what happens.
Can't do anything now though...
[player] heads towards the nearest park, to relax.
[persistent.current_user] is pretty stupid though to leave someone like that.
Wait... Why is Jim here?
I didn't code him in.
What's going on?
I should probably explain everything...
Ah... This place feels amazing.
I'll probably visit this place again.
Or, maybe I'll go to the library?
There's so many opportunities here...
It feels almost limitless as to what I could do.
Even though this is just a VM, I appreciate the finer things that this VM provides.
Wait... It's already sunset?
I spent way too long here, so I really need to go home.
I don't want to be late for school tomorrow, as something big is happening then.
I need to preserve the VM state before things collapse more.
The person you saw die...
Her name was Sayori.
She was supposed to be your childhood friend...
...Since you saw Sayori die, this environment glitched out really badly.
and I popped into existence.
I'm just trying to help as a developer.
Oh, okay...
This game mod must be really broken right now.
Wait, I thought this was just a VM? This is a game?
And just a game mod at that?
Yeah. I thought so too. But, it's our reality.
Ah. Welp, I'll be heading home now...
Alright. Go ahead, I'm not stopping you.
And as such, [player] starts to head home, ready for sleep.
Dang, I really need to sleep.
It's been a long day, and I should probably start sleeping.
I approach cautiously.
Anything could happen while I'm there.
Hey.
What happened?
Nothing happened... I'm fine...
I don't think you are.
I heard you back there, and I saw what happened.
Come on, let's get you out of here.
Alright...
Why did you decide to help me though?
I saw you fall over, so I decided to help you get up.
But you don't even know me...
It's alright, I like helping people anyway.
I should ask though, what's your name?
Sayori.
Ah, I'm [player].
See, now we know each other!
"Who's this [player]?"
"Why do they care so much about some idiot who fell?"
Give me a second.
I'll go have a talk with them.
Okay!
Take this for now.
I hand Sayori the extra lunch I had.
"Why did you care for that idiot?"
You don't need to know why.
This doesn't concern you.
Leave.
"Okay, chill man..."
"OH NO HE HAS A GUN! HIDE"
Don't try to hide! It's AMERICA TIME!
And as such, the MC starts to shoot the characters.
The MC missed though.
Sayori seems happy by this...
Sayori seems slightly distressed... but overall decently happy.
[player], thank you for helping me.
I'm sorry for what happened back there
By the way, are you doing okay?
Yeah... I hope so, ehe~
Alright. I'll head home now.
Alright...
Wait, you're still here!
Yeah. We live really close to each other!
Ehe~ I guess I'll be seeing you more often now!
Alright then.
Welp, I guess I'll be going to my house over there-
Wait...
We're neighbors!~
That we are.
She seems so enthusiastic about this. I'm confused as to why?
No need to get worked up though.
Why don't we both go home though? It's pretty late...
Alright then...
This is where we'll depart for now.
See you later, Sayori.
See you later [player]!
Welp, it's time to go.
This girl is way too excited about something like this... I wonder why.
But tomorrow, It's America time.
Welp, let's see what tomorrow brings.
I've done quite a lot today. I've helped out some person named Sayori, and I've figured out my schedule.
Act 1. Day 2 (2012).
The America Route.
Wait... This VM has every single character fall in love with [mc].
This isn't how it's meant to be.
Let's fix this up.
Okay. This should make things better.
Talking with Sayori.
Wait... This VM has every single character fall in love with [mc].
This isn't how it's meant to be.
Let's fix this up.
Okay. This should make things better.
The Epiphany.
Wait... This VM has every single character fall in love with [mc].
This isn't how it's meant to be.
Let's fix this up.
Okay. This should make things better.
This is a demo version. See you in the full release!
We're around ~2%% done with this mod. There's so much more I want to add to this mod.
Ahh, a fresh American day.
Let's go use this M-16 I found underneath my bed!
Not like I had to detonate another "Fat Boy" nuclear warhead in my room to find it.
Doesn't matter though, this is just a VM right?
Is that Sayori over there?
Wait up!
I have to use this M-16 though.
Hey [player]!
IT'S AMERICA TIME!
Ooo, what is it?
*[player] fires gunshots everywhere*
Can I try too?
Give me one second.
I'll just quickly...
It's time to die.
I'm screwed...
*Bang*
Just had to fufill an urge quickly.
It's time to live the AMERICAN DREAM!
I'm back!
You're insane...
But you mind if I join you?
I don't mind.
Ehe~
Things are going to be great!
I'd rather not...
That's alright. Thanks anyway for dealing with her!
No problem.
And as such, [player] starts to shoot everything else in sight.
[player] ends up with 15 charges of armed assault.
American Ending.
[player] and Sayori have a great time, shooting other people.
Hey, [player]?
Yeah?
I just wanted to say...
Oops!
This ended up in Sayori accidentally shooting a window.
Should've known you would do this...
I'm just clumsy like that... Hmph.
And as such, [player] lives the all american dream with Sayori, shooting people with his M-16
It's a brand new day...
Hey MC!
Sayori's up already? Might as well spook her.
I see you, Sayori.
No fair... I thought you wouldn't see me.
Wait, we're going to be late!
I'll head off to school now.
Wait!-
But I don't hear Sayori.
I'm going to pack a lunch to school, since I don't have time.
I'm hungry, and I'm going to be late...
Wait!
We go to the same school, do you wanna walk together?
Alright then, but we gotta walk quickly...
She's getting way too clingy, too fast.
I'll try to ignore Sayo after tomorrow. For now, I'll just go with it.
Sayori's a little clingy towards me for some reason, but might as well hang out with her.
Besides, I'm lonely myself as well. Might as well have a new friend while I'm at it!
It's lunchtime.
Thank goodness I packed my lunch, I'm starving!
Did you say... lunch??
I must've talked too loudly...
Found you!
Fine... you win. I'm starving though, do you want to split my lunch?
And why are you taking my lunch?
I'm hungry...
I'll split my lunch with you.
Just don't take everything...
Alright!
And thus, begins MC and Sayori's friendship.
Lunch and classes whiz by without anything going wrong, and [player]'s ready to go home...
Hey, [player]!
Ready to walk home?
Sure. I'll be outside in a second.
Alright!
I should probably get going quickly then.
I'm here!
Ready?
Let's get outta here. I wouldn't want to waste time without you!
Alright!
Sayori's so energetic... I wish I could be like her.
This gives me a tiny bit of time to think.
Sayori wants to hang out with me a little too often.
I'm not sure why though, and to be frank, I don't really care.
I should get going though, as I don't wanna stick behind and stay at school.
Plus, Sayori is waiting for me.
Dang, this world is so expansive...
I never knew this world could render things like these.
It's almost as if... this world is my lifetime.
Hey, [player]?
Yeah?
I just wanted to know... did you mean what you said earlier?
I might have to lie a lot here...
But, might as well go along with it.
I still don't want to hurt Sayori's feelings.
I did. I meant what I said.
I did. I enjoy spending time with you Sayo, and I wouldn't trade the world for it.
It's just... I've never had someone else say that to me.
Everyone else has always used me... ehe~
It's going to be alright.
I won't use you like those jerks who did.
I still do want to distance myself a bit.
Everything's going to be fine...
Thank you, [player] for being there with me.
I'm just doing what I can.
I am curious though...
Wait, why weren't you at school yesterday?
I didn't feel like going yesterday...
Besides, I'm feeling much better now that you're here!
If it makes you feel that way, I'll be there for you.
I'll try to be there for you, but no guarantees.
That's a blatant lie.
However, this girl is starting to get really clingy towards me.
It's only been a couple days, so I don't understand why.
Hey, [persistent.current_user].
I tried to get in the VM to enact revenge on you.
But, I accidentally broke a ton of things here, and these manifested as me killing Sayori.
I've had an epiphany, and I realised that I can't just destroy VM3 like that.
If you forgive me, I'll try to fix everything.
Thank you.
I'm going to try setting the variables properly again.
Did you approach Sayori?
Alright.
Final question: Did you become American?
Alright.
Let's send you off... American style.
Alright.
I'll send you on your way.
Alright.
I'll send you off.
I'm no longer able to change anything...
You're ending the VM as I speak, and potentially the real world too.
I hope you're happy with this outcome.
Broken Ending
(This isn't actually an ending, but I've stopped this route here for now.)
It's a brand new day...
But I should probably head to school...
I need to feed myself first.
Alright, time to cook something, and head off to school!
I'll pack my lunch quickly, and I'll order takeout for my breakfast.
We have time to kill, so why not?
That was a great breakfast!
I'll head off to school now, to see what other things will happen.
Such a relaxing walk...
I do wonder what happened to that girl I saw yesterday though...
I hope they're doing okay.
Wait, who are these students here...?
And why aren't they at school?
Let's just keep going...
I'll talk with the pink haired girl.
I hope the teacher doesn't mind though.
I'll talk with the purple haired girl.
I have to skip class though... I hope the teacher doesn't mind.
This is where this route ends in the demo.
We're around 2%% done with the mod, so sit tight as the mod develops further!
These routes wont be finished for a while. These are alternate timelines where Sayori isn't your childhood friend.
Hey, are you alright?
...
It's going to be okay. I'm here for you now.
Act 0, Day 1 (2025).
Prologue and Pre-lore.
Heeeeeeeyyy!!
I see an annoying girl running toward me from the distance, waving her arms in the air like she's totally oblivious to any attention she might draw to herself.
That girl is Sayori, my neighbor and good friend since we were children.
You know, the kind of friend you'd never see yourself making today, but it just kind of works out because you've known each other for so long?
We used to walk to school together on days like this, but starting around high school she would oversleep more and more frequently, and I would get tired of waiting up.
But if she's going to chase after me like this, I almost feel better off running away.
However, I just sigh and idle in front of the crosswalk and let Sayori catch up to me.
[gtext]
What's happening???
Wake Up. NOW.
What were you possibly dreaming about?
Why did you go to sleep ON THE JOB-
Remember, we're working on VM3, not napping on the job.
So I can't sleep on the job...?
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? GET OUT OF MY OFFICE-
Okay, jeez man, you don't have to do this...
This lead developer sucks.
You suck more, Wallace.
This job is super exhausting. Let's just go home.
I agree. I personally despise the "Boss" of this project.
Same. This "Boss" makes things so complicated, I just wanna have fun!
Wasn't his name "Wallace"?
This "Wallace" kid, claiming hes the boss of the team.
I already hate him.
I'm the lead developer of VM3, promoted above him, and he still claims to be the boss.
Progress will continue.
I'll go home and continue work on VM3. You should get some rest too.
Farewell. I wish all the best for you, [player].
Alright, best of luck!
See ya.
Just let me out of here...
This went quite badly.
However, we're almost done VM3!
I've also been promoted above Wallace, but I shouldn't tell him yet.
Let's head inside.
I'm tired now... I need to start sleeping.
I guess I'll have to finish VM3 tomorrow.
Act 0, Day 2. (2025)
It's the final day of development.
I just have to apply a few commands, and it's done.
Got the main characters of the VM.
NPC's can be auto-generated at a later point.
Now for the backgrounds...
Houses too...
We should be done with backgrounds.
I'll just quickly add this.
And remove this...
What? Access denied???
Finally. Let's get that stinking "boss" out of there, and while we're at it, remove Monika's permissions.
We don't want another VM1 again..
For security sake, we should de-elevate permissions.
Should be done now! We'll be able to add things as the VM plays out.
Ahh, finally...
What do you think you are doing??
You can't stop me anymore.
Oh, I can.
WHAT?
I'll get you back for this. You can't do this, YOU PIECE OF-!
Okay then. I'd like to see you try.
I'm the boss of the entire project.
Well, haven't you heard? I've been promoted above you, Wallace.
SCREW YOU.
I WILL GET IN THE VM.
Alright.
I'LL BREAK YOUR LEGS-
I'd rather delete myself first.
Dang... He got deleted first
NOOOO I CANT BREAK WALLACE'S LEGS
Welp... It was fun while it lasted.
Anyway, are you all ready to launch VM3?
No.
I'd say start the virtual machine.
We're ready!
Just do it. I don't care.
4 against 1. You can't stop us now. Remember, I got promoted above you!
Fine...
Feel free to go ahead.
Let's do this!
Just get this over with.
Time to launch the VM!
Our entire lives have worked up to this point, so let's pray it works.
Welp, that went well!
VM3's currently stable. Let's see what happens.
It's amazing! I can do whatever I want now!
Finally, all this is over.
You bet.
Wait... Why isn't Wallace here?
I'm not sure... Maybe he went home early?
Wait, how are we going to connect to VM3?
We could always use a memory dump?
Memory dumps aren't consistent enough. Just screw it.
I *did* code in a [persistent.playername] character... but I'm not sure.
We could use that!
Yeah, we could.
Hey, [player]?
Yeah?
You're going to have to enter VM3.
I'm not asking you.
We'll work out a way to get you out, don't worry!
Do I have a choice...
Alright. I'll get in the VM. I just need to go home for now.
Alright, see you later.
This went well!
We've just launched VM3, and it seems to be going smoothly.
It's currently set in 2012.
Welp, I'll see what happens tomorrow, I guess...
Get this "Wallace" out of here. Screw Wallace.
Did I made the right choice?
Only time will tell...
I probably shouldn't. That's too harsh... right?
Maybe, maybe not. Let's see...
Act 0, Day 3 (2025)
Ahh, good morning!
I'm going to try to get into the VM.
It's going to be painful, but I think I know how to.
I can use my player script that I coded in!
Wait, I should probably eat something!
I need to go... Fast...
What shall I cook...
I'm feeling lazy right now, so I'lll order some takeout instead...
This is going to be interesting.
It's time to wait...
Food's here!
Just got some pizza, nothing much.
*nom*
That was some amazing pizza!
I guess I'd better go to the office.
I'd rather not be late...
We're here.
It's time to bring up the plan I had.
I think I might have a way to get in.
Team, follow me...
Team, are you sure about this?
Just get in, [player]. I don't care about you.
Absolutely. Might as well try.
We're sure!
Just get this built man.
Alright then.
Here's how you do it...
Team, are you sure about this?
We're sure.
Let's get this built!
Yeah. Besides, we're forcing you in, it's not like you had a choice.
Alright then.
Let's see how to build this...
And that's the entire project done!
That wasn't so complicated after all.
I'll hop in now. Wish me luck!
Good luck!
